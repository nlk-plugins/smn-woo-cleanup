Hooks to some Woo Commerce filters and actions to re-arrange and clean up some things.


== Description ==

Hooks to some Woo Commerce filters and actions to re-arrange and clean up some things. Replicating static PHP landing pages with WooCommerce One Page Checkout and magic.

woocommerce template files in this plugin are just stored here for reference. They should actually exist in the current active theme.

Currently the vlanding js & css are injected based on the hardcoded slug of that one page, too. Not the most robust.


== Installation ==

1. Upload file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the SMN Woo Cleanup plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress Admin Panel
3. Manually copy the woocommerce template files to the current theme
